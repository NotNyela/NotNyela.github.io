### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I know it's pretty simple, but Lab 1 was one of my favorites for this
    class because of the highly favored "Hello World" text print on the
    terminal. I've been coding since the fourth grade, and I remember my
    first session consisted of printing Hello World on the screen. However,
    the fact that I officially learned to print it out in C++ made it an
    adorable full-circle moment.

* Lab 08

    In Lab 08, part 1 was my favorite as we checked for the correct amount
    of arguments when accepting items to make a sandwich using Madlibs. It
    was a clever and fun way to code command-line arguments. By completing
    the code, I could understand how to code command-line arguments and use
    the logic of arguments in future labs.

* Lab 04

    Lab 04, part 2 was my favorite because, as I mentioned previously, I
    have experience in coding, and one of my favorite things to code in
    JavaScript and Python were if and else statements. In part 2, we
    embedded an if/else statement into an else statement. It was a neat and
    clear example of showcasing if and else statements since we had to make
    a Higher or Lower game, and what better way to do that than with If/Else
    statements?
